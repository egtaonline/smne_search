1. Set equilibrium_evaluator._GA to the location of the game analysis script

2. Set equilibrium_evaluator._r to regret threshold for approximate NE (see AnalysisScript.py for more information)

3. Set equilibrium_evaluator._d to difference threshold for mixed strategy profiles (see AnalysisScript.py for more information)

4. In smne_search.py: 
   a. Modify 'GENERIC_SCHEDULER_ID', 'GAME_ID', and 'SIMULATOR_ID' accordingly. 
   b. Set EMAIL_ADDRESSES to indicate the list of people that will receive update emails
   c. Set NUM_SAMPLES to the number of samples needed for each profile 
   d. Set ADDITIONAL_NUM_SAMPLES to the number of samples needed to improve confidence for each profile

5. Quick run:

python2.7 smne_search.py 1 <game_data_file> <equi_file> <out_file>

<game_data_file>: where the game data file (json) will be downloaded by the script
<equi_file>: where the result of game analysis will be stored 
<out_file>: final game analysis file
